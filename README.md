## Introduction

During my internship at CodSoft, I was assigned 5 tasks that covered a wide range of programming concepts and real-world applications. These tasks were instrumental in helping me develop my skills in Java programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and software development. This repository is a reflection of my dedication and hard work throughout the internship.

## Tasks

Below is the list of tasks I have completed as part of this internship:

- Task 1: Number Guessing Game

Description: A fun and interactive game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides hints and tracks the number of attempts.

Folder: Task 1 - NumberGuessingGame.java

- Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
 
Description: A program that calculates a student's grade based on their marks in multiple subjects. It also computes the average percentage and displays the final grade.

Folder: Task 2 -  StudentGradeCalc.java
